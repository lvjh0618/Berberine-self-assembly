# Self-assembly of Herbal Small Molecules (Berberine)

## Overview
This repository presents a reproducible workflow for studying the self-assembly behavior of herbal small molecules (e.g. berberine) using molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis.

This project is part of my MSc research at Nanjing Agricultural University, focusing on antimicrobial mechanisms relevant to aquaculture disease control.

## Research Question
How do berberine molecules self-assemble in aqueous environments, and what structural features may be related to their antibacterial activity?

## Methods
- Molecular Dynamics simulations using **GROMACS**
- Trajectory analysis using **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib, MDAnalysis)
- Data visualization and statistical analysis

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`: end-to-end analysis workflow
- `results/figures/`: figures generated from simulations
- `scripts/`: example scripts for running simulations (to be added)

## Current Status
- Simulation system setup completed
- Preliminary trajectory analysis in progress
- Figures and quantitative analysis will be updated
