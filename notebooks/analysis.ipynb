# Analysis of Berberine Self-Assembly by MD Simulation

This notebook presents the analysis workflow for molecular dynamics simulations
of berberine self-assembly in aqueous solution.

The purpose is to explore aggregation behavior and structural features
relevant to antibacterial activity.
## 1. Research Question

- How do berberine molecules aggregate over simulation time?
- What structural features characterize the self-assembled clusters?
- How stable are these aggregates during MD simulation?
## 2. Simulation System

- Molecule: Berberine
- Environment: Aqueous solution
- MD engine: GROMACS
- Simulation output: trajectory (.xtc) and structure (.gro)
# Import basic libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# MDAnalysis will be used for trajectory analysis
# import MDAnalysis as mda
## 3. Load Trajectory Data

In this section, the molecular dynamics trajectory and topology files
will be loaded for analysis.
# Example (to be completed):
# u = mda.Universe("topology.gro", "trajectory.xtc")
## 4. Structural Analysis

Planned analyses include:
- Radial distribution function (RDF)
- Intermolecular distance analysis
- Cluster size distribution
# Placeholder for RDF or distance calculations
# Results will be visualized as time-dependent plots
## 5. Preliminary Discussion

This section will summarize observed aggregation behavior
and discuss its possible relevance to antibacterial mechanisms.

Further simulations and quantitative analysis are ongoing.
